# The Mantle Manifesto

## Why Every AI Agent Needs an Operating System

> "AI agents are the new apps. But unlike apps, they can act autonomously. Without infrastructure, they become liabilities."

## The Problem We're Solving

The year is 2025, and AI agents are everywhere.

They browse the web, write code, make purchases, send emails, and interact with each other. OpenAI's Operator, Anthropic's Claude Computer Use, and dozens of open-source frameworks have made it trivial to build an agent that can *do things*.

But here's the problem nobody is talking about:

**There's no infrastructure for agent accountability, safety, memory, or coordination.**

When your agent makes a $50,000 purchase by mistake, who's liable? When two agents try to modify the same database record, who wins? When your agent drifts from its original goal, how do you detect it?

These are infrastructure problems. And they're unsolved.

## The Operating System Analogy

In the 1970s, every program managed its own memory, file access, and hardware. It was chaos. Then Unix came along and said: *"These are common problems. Let the OS handle them."*

AI agents are in the same position today. Every framework is reinventing:
- Authentication and identity
- Safety guardrails
- State management
- Resource coordination

We believe it's time for an **Agentic Operating System**.

## Introducing VeriMantle

**VeriMantle** is the foundational layer for autonomous AI agents.

We provide five universal primitives — the **Five Pillars** — that every agent needs:

### 🪪 Identity
Every agent action is cryptographically signed. When something goes wrong, you know *exactly* which agent did what and when. Liability is traceable. Agents have **verifiable reputations** built on their transaction history.

### 🛡️ Gate  
Before any action executes, it passes through our **Neuro-Symbolic Verification Engine**. Deterministic policy checks in under 1ms. Semantic malice detection (prompt injection, social engineering) in under 20ms.

### 🧠 Synapse
Agents have goals, not just actions. Synapse tracks **Intent Paths** — the progression from goal to completion. When an agent starts taking more steps than expected, we detect **drift** before it becomes a problem. Automatic alerting via webhooks.

### ⚖️ Arbiter
When multiple agents need the same resource, Arbiter provides **Atomic Business Locks** with priority-based scheduling. No race conditions. No double-spending. No chaos.

### 💰 Treasury *(New)*
Agents can **pay each other** for services. Treasury provides atomic transfers with 2-phase commit, spending budgets, and micropayment aggregation. The missing infrastructure for the **Agentic Economy**.

## The Technical Stack

We're not building toys. VeriMantle is engineered for production:

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|------------|-----|
| SDK | TypeScript | Developer experience, ecosystem fit |
| Core | Rust | Performance, memory safety, concurrency |
| State | CRDTs | Eventual consistency without coordination |
| Consensus | Raft | Strong consistency when needed |
| Neural | ONNX | Fast ML inference (<20ms) |

Our verification engine processes **10,000+ requests per second** on a single node.

## Open Core Philosophy

VeriMantle is **open source at the foundation**:

**MIT Licensed (Free Forever)**:
- `@verimantle/sdk` — TypeScript client
- `verimantle-identity` — Agent authentication
- `verimantle-gate` — Policy verification
- `verimantle-synapse` — State management
- `verimantle-arbiter` — Coordination
- `verimantle-treasury` — Agent payments

**Commercial (VeriMantle Cloud)**:
- Multi-node orchestration
- Global state synchronization  
- Compliance UI and audit logs
- Enterprise SLAs

We want VeriMantle to be the *default* infrastructure for agents. The SDK will always be free.

---

## Global From Day One

AI agents don't respect borders. A US-built agent might process data for an EU customer stored in Singapore. Regulations like GDPR, PIPL, and DPDP create a compliance nightmare.

VeriMantle handles this with **data residency awareness** built into every API:

```typescript
const client = new VeriMantle({ region: 'eu' });
// All data stays in the EU. Cross-border transfers are blocked automatically.
```

---

## The Bigger Picture

We're not just building infrastructure. We're enabling a new economy.

With VeriMantle, agents can:
- Have **verifiable reputations** built on their transaction history *(Identity + Trust Scoring)*
- **Pay each other** for services via micropayment rails *(Treasury)*
- Be **legally incorporated** as LLCs, shielding developers from liability
- Humans maintain **oversight and control** through a Mission Control UI

This is the **Agentic Economy**. And VeriMantle is its operating system.

---

## Get Started Today

```bash
npm install @verimantle/sdk
```

```typescript
import { VeriMantle } from '@verimantle/sdk';

const client = new VeriMantle();
const agent = await client.identity.register('my-first-agent');

console.log('Welcome to the future.');
```
